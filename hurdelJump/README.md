### Hurdle Jump - Create a function that takes: 

1. **An Array** of **Hurdle Heights** and a Jumper's **Jump height**. 
1. Check whether the **Hurdler** (jumper) can clear all the **Hurdles** (hurdle heights) or not.

Note:- A hurdler can clear a hurdle if their jump height is **Greater than or Equal** to the hurdle height.

1. If hurdler can clear all the hurdles then show **'can clear'** in the console. 
1. If hurdler can not clear all the hurdles then show **'can not clear'** in the console.

> hurdleJump([5, 9, 13, 16], 20) ➞ 'can clear'

> hurdleJump([10, 25, 47], 30) ➞ 'can not clear'

> hurdleJump([23, 5, 19], 26) ➞ 'can clear'
