### Mangle the String - Create a function that takes: 

1. One **String** as an argument. 
1. **Replaces Every Letter** of **Argument String** with the **Letter Following** it in the **Alphabet**. ("e" becomes "f", "y" becomes "z", "m" becomes "n", etc).
1. Then **Capitalize Every Vowel** (a, e, i, o, u) and shows the **New Modified String** in the console.

> mangleTheStr("Monday") ➞ "NpOEbz"

> mangleTheStr("I am self - taught programmer!!!!") ➞ "J bn tfmg - UbvhIU qsphsbnnfs!!!!"

> mangleTheStr("my age is @ 23.") ➞ "nz bhf jt @ 23."

Note : If a **Letter** is **Already Uppercase**, show it as **Uppercase** in the console. (Regardless of being a Vowel).
