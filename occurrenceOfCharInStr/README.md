### Count Instances (Occurrence) of a Character in a String - Create a function that takes: 

1. **Two Strings**, in which one is **Character** and one is **String**, as arguments. 
1. Find out **How Many Times** the character is **Found** in the string, and show that **Number** in the console.

Note : The **Output** should be **Case - Sensitive** (See 2nd Example).

> charInstance('e', 'twelve') ➞ 2

> charInstance('m', 'Meme') ➞ 1

> charInstance('a', 'june') ➞ "Not even occurred for 'One Time'"
