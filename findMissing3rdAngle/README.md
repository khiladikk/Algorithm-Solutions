### Missing Third Angle - Create a function that takes: 

1. **2 integer** angle degrees of a triangle as arguments. 
1. Show **Missing Third Value** angle of triangle with one of the below output in the console:
    1. If the **Third Angle** is smaller than 90 degrees then show **'acute'** in the console.
    1. If the **Third Angle** is exactly 90 degrees, then show **'right'** in the console.
    1. If the **Third Angle** is greater then 90 degrees, than show **'obtuse'** in the console.

Note: The sum of angles of any triangle is always **180 Degrees**.      

> missing3rdAngle(50, 60) ➞ 'acute' with value of 70 degrees. 

> missing3rdAngle(45, 45) ➞ 'right' with value of 90 degrees.

> missing3rdAngle(25, 50) ➞ 'obtuse' with value of 105 degrees.
