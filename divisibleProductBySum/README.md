### Product Divisible By Sum? - Create a function that takes: 

1. An **Integer Array** as an argument. 
1. Find out whether the **Product** of integer array's elements is **divisible** by the **Sum** of array's elements.
    1. If product is divisible by sum of array's elements, then show **'divisible'** in the console.
    1. If product is not divisible by sum of array's elements, then show **'not divisible'** in the console.

> divisibleProductBySum([22, 5, 19]) ➞ 'not divisible'

> divisibleProductBySum([15, 10, 5]) ➞ 'divisible'

> divisibleProductBySum([26, 23, 7]) ➞ 'not divisible'
